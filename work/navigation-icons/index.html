                <h1>Site Redesign: Navigation and Icons</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>For quite some time, my supervisors had been talking with the BYU Library administration about
                    redesigning the Library website. As a team, we started thinking about a redesign and how it would
                    work logistically. We decided to start researching and brainstorming, even though the actual
                    redesign wouldn't be happening immediately. I was tasked with creating a new navigation style for
                    the redesign.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>I began with research. I looked at all sorts of navigation styles, and I quickly found that there
                    aren't actually that many different styles. I knew that we were moving away from the sidebar
                    navigation, so I researched more about top-bar navigation styles. I also researched best practices
                    for dropdown menus. Designing a page footer was also part of this project, so I made sure to
                    research best practices for footers too.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>After researching, I started sketching. Since the research phase narrowed down the possible
                    navigation styles for me, the sketching process went quickly. Soon after sketching, I created an
                    example wireframe of the navigation bar and footer in Whimsical, and I made two different dropdown
                    styles.</p>

            <article>
                <p>I conducted several user interviews to ask users about their preferences on the navigation bar,
                    footer, and dropdown styles. The interviews were very informative and helped me know which design I
                    should move forward with.</p>
                <p>Icons were a big part of the wireframe design I had put together. After I had validated the wireframe
                    with users, I started looking for icon sets. I found a free icon set with both outlined and filled
                    icons. Then I began choosing icons for the navigation items needed for the project. This was an
                    important part of the project because I needed to find items for complex ideas like "Course Reserve"
                    and "Family History Library."</p>
                <p>I sorted through the icon set I had chosen and found several potential icons for each of the
                    navigation items. I showed my choices to the team and got their feedback to narrow down the options.
                    We determined that some of the options weren't very strong, so we brainstormed and found better
                    ideas for icons for those items. I created several custom icons based on our ideas. I made sure to
                    design the icons to match the style of the rest of the icon set. I also created an outlined and
                    filled version of each new icon I created.</p>

                <p>I decided to conduct more user interviews to ask users their opinions of the icons. After the
                    interviews, I knew which icons worked and which ones didn't. From there I was able to focus on two
                    navigation items that needed more work. I collaborated with the team to get more feedback from them,
                    and with their help, I was able to create two new icons that better represented the two navigation
                    items that still needed icons.</p>

                        <p>I started prototyping in Adobe XD after I had narrowed down the icons. I started building the
                            navigation bar and dropdowns. It was easy to build out the different dropdowns because I
                            made
                            components of the navigation elements. Then I built the footer. After getting feedback from
                            my
                            supervisor and team, I made some refinements to the prototype.</p>
                        <p>As part of the overall site redesign, we want to include a dark mode version. I created a
                            dark mode
                            version so that we could visualize how the navigation bar and footer would look in dark
                            mode.</p>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <p>Since the site redesign won't be happening for a few months, this project is on hold until then. Once
                    the project is picked back up and merged with the other redesign projects, I will conduct more user
                    testing to validate the navigation and icons in relation to the site as a whole.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>While studying navigation bars, I learned that they are simple but can also be very complex. I
                    noticed how regular menus vary from mega-menus and how hover effects can make or break a navbar. I
                    also learned about the impact that icons can have on a navbar. I researched lots of icons for this
                    project, many of them to represent complex ideas. I was able to learn how to communicate an idea
                    with a simple icon. I also learned the best practices for making icons. As a whole, this project
                    taught me many important things about the essential part of an interface.</p>
