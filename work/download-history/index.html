                <h1>Download History</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>At the BYU Library, a patron's checkout history is saved. The Library decided that they needed to
                    stop keeping a complete history for each patron, so they chose to purge each patron's data that was
                    more than five years old. They wanted to give the option to the patrons to download their history
                    before it got deleted, and I was asked to find a solution. </p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>I researched how date pickers are used on other websites. I looked at how they function and what they
                    look like. I wanted to find a date picker style that was common enough to be easy for users to use,
                    but that could also be used for the specific need to download Library history. As I researched, I
                    read a few articles on best practices for date selection components. I found an example of a date
                    picker that I thought fit the criteria that I mentioned earlier.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>With the findings of my research in mind, I started to brainstorm different ideas. I started
                    sketching out these ideas and I came up with a few different sketches. The sketches demonstrated
                    different possible workflows.</p>

        <section class="normal-background">
            <article>
                <p>I showed my sketches to my supervisor and I received feedback from him. He and I were able to discuss
                    the benefits and drawbacks of each of the different workflows. We picked the one we thought was the
                    best, and from there I was able to sketch out more details relevant to the workflow we picked.</p>
                <p>Then I started building a prototype of the sketch in Adobe XD. First I created the essential screens
                    to get the idea across. I showed this initial prototype to the team and got their feedback. I was
                    able to implement their feedback as I finished building the prototype. Once I finished, I showed the
                    team again and they really liked how it turned out.</p>

            <article>
                <p>After receiving good feedback from the team, I began testing the prototype with users. Each user test
                    ran smoothly. After several tests, it was apparent that the design was usable and that the users
                    could easily complete the tasks I had given them.</p>

        <!-- ---------- RESULTS/LESSONS LEARNED ---------- -->
        <section class="normal-background no-padding-top">
            <article>
                <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
                <p>I learned a lot from this quick project. I learned how there are several different ways to achieve
                    the same solution. I was also reminded of the importance of brainstorming and how my first idea
                    usually isn't the best one. I studied the best practices for date selection, and I made sure to
                    implement them. I honed my skills in Adobe XD and was able to make a dynamic prototype that was easy
                    to edit. In the end, I was able to create a practical interface because of the things that I
                    learned.</p>
