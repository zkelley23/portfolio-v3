                <h1>Collection Management Services</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This project came from the Special Collections department of the BYU Library. They have a service
                    where they provide materials to use along with the special collection items. An employee always had
                    to be at the desk if someone came to make a request or return because their system was paper-based.
                    I was able to design a web-based system for them so that they could streamline and simplify the
                    material request/return process and allow people to initiate a request/return remotely.</p>
                <p>There wasn't a style guide or design system I needed to follow for this project. I knew that from the
                    beginning, so I was able to start the research/brainstorming process knowing that I had some design
                    freedom.</p>

        <!-- ---------- RESEARCH ---------- -->
        <section class="normal-background">
            <article>
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>As I researched for systems similar to the one I needed to design, I realized that I could model the
                    project after e-commerce check-out processes. Requesting materials from Special Collections was
                    essentially like ordering something online. I noticed how some websites have carts and check-outs
                    with multiple steps split up into multiple pages, and others have everything on one page. I also saw
                    that many sites implement some form of order summary. These were all things I took into
                    consideration as I began designing.</p>
                <p>This project gave me the chance to research form elements. I studied best practices for input fields,
                    dropdown fields, and date pickers. I noticed that the best form elements all followed similar
                    guidelines. I made sure to implement these best practices as I started sketching and designing.</p>

        <section class="background svg-gray top">
            <article>
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I sketched out some of my ideas. Some of the sketches took on a multi-page approach, and others were
                    based on a one-page design. As I kept sketching, I realized that it made the most sense to iterate
                    on the one-page design. The system was simple enough that it would be more complicated by splitting
                    up the steps into multiple pages. I also sketched out ideas for a confirmation page as well as a
                    contact page.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Once I solidified a design sketch, I began prototyping in Adobe XD. I built out the prototype
                            based on the sketch. I was able to update things here and there as I received feedback on
                            the prototype. I also built a mobile version prototype. The design translated well to
                            mobile, so it was just as easy to make a request/return as it was on a desktop. I finished
                            the prototype by creating a design system to help the developers know exactly what
                            components needed to be built.</p>

                <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
                <p>This project gave me the chance to design an interface from scratch. I read about and studied best
                    practices for form elements such as text fields, dropdowns, and buttons. I learned how form labels
                    should function and how form elements should be laid out in relationship with each other.</p>
                <p>The inspiration I got from e-commerce sites helped me understand how users should progress through a
                    form, especially a form with segmented steps. I integrated all of this knowledge into the project to
                    create an attractive, functional interface.</p>
