                <h1>Study Room Reservation Redesign</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>As I was looking through the BYU Library website, I noticed that the Study Room Scheduling page could
                    be improved. I talked with my supervisor about it, and she gave me permission to start working on a
                    redesign since it had already been on the office's radar.</p>

        <!-- ---------- RESEARCH ---------- -->
        <section class="normal-background">
            <article>
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>I began by thinking about how students currently schedule a study room. I also thought about how
                    students would ideally schedule a study room. The Study Room Scheduler was not mobile-friendly at
                    all. I decided that I would focus on the mobile experience first because it would be much more
                    convenient for a student to schedule a study room on their phone instead of their computer. I also
                    decided to focus my initial redesign efforts on designing the feature into the BYU iOS app instead
                    of just a mobile website version. This would make it even easier for a student to schedule a study
                    room.</p>
                <p>I researched how a scheduling app should work. I found inspiration in all sorts of places. I also
                    researched and read Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for iOS. This gave me insight into how my
                    interface should work. I also learned about using Apple's design language for the app. By designing
                    an app using Apple's components, I would be able to design screens and interactions that the users
                    would already be familiar with. Plus, the BYU app was already built this way so I wanted to match
                    it.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I started brainstorming and sketching out some ideas. I referenced the Human Interface Guidelines
                    frequently so that I could match the drawings to iOS components. After different iterations of
                    screens and user flows, I was able to solidify my ideas. Once the sketches were complete, I showed
                    them to my supervisor. She was really excited to see my work, and she gave me feedback. I then
                    showed the head developer and got his input as well.</p>

        <section class="normal-background no-padding-top">

                <h2>Next steps</h2>
                <p>The next step in this project will be conducting user research and testing. I need to talk with users
                    to find out what is most important to them when they go to schedule a study room. I also need to
                    interview users and show them my sketches to see if they think my idea would be useful.</p>
                <p>As for now, the project is on hold. The redesign of this feature won't be happening for some time due
                    to a current lack of developers in the office.</p>

                <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
                <p>This was my first project for mobile. I was able to study and learn a lot about interface and
                    interaction design for mobile. As mentioned above, I learned a lot about Apple's Human Interface
                    Guidelines. I learned how those guidelines are put into play when designing a mobile app. I learned
                    how to cut out unnecessary clutter and simplify screens. This helped me design screens where the
                    user could focus on their goal and easily complete it. I also learned a lot about the importance of
                    wireframing and user flows.</p>
