                <h1>Library Floor Maps</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This project was my first introduction to wayfinding. My supervisor asked me to redesign the Library
                    floor maps as part of a bigger project to improve wayfinding at the Library.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>I began by researching maps. I looked at best practices for creating maps, both for indoor and
                    outdoor settings. I analyzed how to draw attention to the most important things on the map while
                    also including the less important things. I also researched how to make the new maps accessible so
                    that anyone could read and understand the map without any issues.</p>

        <!-- ---------- PROCESS ---------- -->

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>One of the main goals I had for this project was to simplify the maps. I wanted to cut out any
                    unnecessary clutter. I decided to create the new map based on a grid system. I started by outlining
                    the building and the rooms and aligning everything to the grid. Doing this reduced the amount
                    clashing lines and made the map easier to scan.</p>
                <img src="../../images/maps/map-outline.svg" alt="Outlined floor map of the third floor of the Harold B. Lee Library in Provo, Utah" class="desktop desktop-md" loading="lazy" />
                <p>Once I had the building layout done, I started thinking about how to include icons and labels. I
                    wanted to streamline the use of icons throughout the map. I also wanted to reduce the number of font
                    sizes where possible to make the map easy to read. I used a simple icon set that I used in a
                    previous project. I also needed to create a few icons for unique items in the Library. I created
                    templates of icons and labels in a few different sizes and layouts to accommodate various placements
                    on the map. Once I had solidified these templates, I labeled the different rooms and areas
                    throughout the maps.</p>

        <section class="normal-background">
            <article>
                <p>Then I starting thinking about how to improve the map legend. My goal of simplification was the same
                    for the legend. I reorganized the legend items into four specific groups. Each item in the group was
                    related to the other items in the group. Only some of the previous legend items had icons. I chose
                    to include an icon for every legend item for consistency and to make it easier to understand the
                    map.</p>
                <p>efore I started adding color to the maps, my supervisor and I examined the maps in black and white.
                    We looked at the grid-based layout in conjunction with the icons and labels. After some small
                    tweaks, we were happy with the layout and placement of everything.</p>
                <p>When I started thinking about color, I focused on a few things. I wanted to use blue to match the
                    Library's branding. I also wanted to choose a color palette that would be accessible to anyone with
                    vision impairment. Keeping the color palette simple was another thing I thought about while
                    brainstorming. At first, I tried using a colorful yet harmonious palette. The colors worked well
                    together, but there were so many colors that it was hard to understand the map at a glance. From
                    there I tried several different color schemes based on a few shades of blue, a blue-green, and a
                    yellow. I was closer to a solid palette with this iteration, but not quite there.</p>

        <section class="background svg-sky top">
            <article>
                <p>After getting feedback from my supervisor and the team, I reorganized the grouping of items in the
                    legend. That ended up providing a push in the right direction to finding the final color palette. I
                    picked blue, purple, and yellow to represent the three new groups. I picked three shades of those
                    colors to represent and indicate further grouping within each group. And I chose gray to represent
                    the fourth and least important group. The new color palette was perfect for the new legend. The
                    colors and grouping made it really easy to understand the map.</p>

                <p>We decided we wanted to enhance accessibility for colorblindness. I experimented with a few different
                    pattern options. I ultimately settled on stripe, checker, and dot patterns. We tested the patterns
                    with a couple colorblind users, and they were able to understand the map quickly. They appreciated
                    the inclusion of the patterns.</p>

                <p>We were confident in moving forward with the project since we validated the maps with several users.
                    Before moving to production, I did a walkthrough of the entire library to check the maps for
                    accuracy. I found a few typos and some other corrections that needed to be made. After making those
                    corrections, I had the maps printed at full size. My supervisor and I looked over the printed proofs
                    and determined that we were ready for production.</p>

        <!-- ---------- RESULTS/LESSONS LEARNED ---------- -->
        <section class="normal-background">
            <article>
                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>This project taught me the importance of wayfinding. I never knew what wayfinding was before, and now
                    I realize how similar it is to user experience design. It was cool being able to think about user
                    experience design in regards to physical spaces. I learned how to translate three-dimensional spaces
                    onto a two-dimensional surface. I also learned about how to design for accessibility for a print
                    medium. I thought about colorblindness more than I ever had. Learning the basics of wayfinding made
                    me fall in love with it. I love designing digital interfaces, but I love the physical aspect of
                    wayfinding design.</p>
