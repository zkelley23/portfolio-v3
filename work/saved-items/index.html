                <h1>Saved Items</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The My Account section of the BYU Library website had recently been redesigned, but the Bookmarks
                    page within My Account had not been updated as part of the redesign. I was asked to make the
                    Bookmarks page match the rest of the new My Account interface while also finding ways to improve the
                    Bookmarks system.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>I quickly found that many things within the Bookmarks system could be improved upon. As I noticed
                    these things, I began researching how to improve them. I looked up how data categorization and
                    tagging works in other systems. I researched design best practices to understand why I should design
                    components a certain way. As the project evolved, I experimented with several apps and websites such
                    as Amazon, Apple Music, and Instagram to see how saving and categorizing items should work. I wanted
                    to create interactions that users would be familiar with. After doing research, I was ready to start
                    ideating.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I created several versions of sketches of how to improve the usability of Bookmarks. I received and
                    implemented feedback on the sketches which helped refine the workflow of the improved system I was
                    imagining.</p>
                <p>As I showed my sketches to the team and as we brainstormed, we realized that "bookmarks" may have not
                    been the right word for the system. We decided to change the name from Bookmarks to Saved Items.
                    This new approach to the system helped me better understand its core function. We also thought that
                    the new name would help our users instinctively know the purpose of the system. This also led to new
                    ideas and new sketches. The new ideas moved away from Bookmarks for saving and labels for
                    categorization to Saved Items for saving and lists for categorization.</p>

                <p>The new direction of the project helped us find a better solution for the system. After having picked
                    the best sketch I had come up with, I started building a medium-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD.</p>
                <p>Once the prototype was finished, I prepped for a user test. I adapted a user testing protocol from
                    Rocket Surgery Made Easy by Steve Krug, and I wrote the user tasks. I ran the user test with five
                    participants. I received valuable feedback from the test. I found validation that the design I had
                    made was useful and easy to use. I also found several things that I could improve about the design.

                <p>After validating the medium-fidelity prototype with users, I started working on the high-fidelity
                    version of the prototype. This involved refining the design as a whole as well as implementing
                    feedback I received along the way. Throughout the last few weeks of the project, I received feedback
                    from my team several times and I also received feedback from the developers. All of this feedback
                    was helpful to me to find the right solutions to pieces of the design that needed to be improved.

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>This project was my first project as a UX/UI designer. I learned a lot about project workflow and
                    UX/UI design best practices. I found that I have a knack for sketching early prototype ideas. Since
                    this first project, sketching on my iPad has been an integral part of my design process throughout
                    all of my projects. The main takeaway that I got from this project is the importance of iterative
                    design. I sketched ideas, designed low- and medium-fidelity prototypes received feedback, and
                    conducted user tests in several rounds before I reached the final, high-fidelity prototype. My very
                    first idea for this project probably would have worked, but because of the iterative design process,
                    I was able to find an even better solution.</p>
